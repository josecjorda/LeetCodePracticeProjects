# LeetCodePracticeProjects
Little projects used to practice leet code problems, data structures, and express myself.

Each project will be created in a respective file/folder with a comment describing thoughts on a project and what I'm trying to practice. I think it'd would be fun to almost treat these as a kind of diary of little ideas that came to mind that I decided to build.

To avoid having a cluttered repository, I plan to keep all projects that stem from this idea here.
